# Swordio

**Swordio** is a 2D esoteric language inspired by [Marbelous](https://github.com/marbelous-lang/docs) and [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/).

## Introduction

Welcome... to war. You are a member of the Canny Clan, who is being invaded by the Argands, from the complex plane. It is up to you to defend your clans castle.

Now, the Canny Clan isn't just any ordinary clan - it's the smartest clan in the world! And as a result, the leader, Mr Egghead, wants to utilize the war situation in the best way possible - and what better way to do this, than by performing calculations! So, with an almost endless supply of weapons, soldiers, and pirates, you get to do some useful calculations, while also defending your civilizations from the imaginary warriors. Good luck.

## Usage

To learn how to write **Swordio** programs, take a look at the [language documentation](https://github.com/cpdt/swordio/wiki/Language).

> Web based editor/debugger coming soon!

The 'official' **Swordio** interpreter is written in Javascript, and runs on NodeJS - install it with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install swordio -g
```

To run code from a file, use the `swordio` command:

```bash
swordio [file]
```

For more information on the command-line interface, including usages, take a look at the [interpreter documentation](https://github.com/cpdt/swordio/wiki/Interpreter).

## Credits

The first version of Swordio, as well as the Javascript interpreter, were created by ctdp.

The language is inspired by a similar esoteric language, [Marbelous](https://github.com/marbelous-lang/marbelous.py) created by cjfaure with the aid of Martin BÃ¼ttner, Nathan Merrill, overactor, sparr, githubphagocyte, es0124, and Visual Melon.

Swordio is also inspired by the game/simulator [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/), created by [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com).
